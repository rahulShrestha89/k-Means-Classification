# This program implements the k-Means clustering algorithm.

# Input Description:
#   First	line:	(N)	Number	of	examples
#   Second	line:	(X)	Number	of	attributes
#   Third	line:	(k)	Number	of	clusters	to	be	created
#   Following	N	lines	contain	X+1 values	containing	the	data	set,	separated	by	comma
